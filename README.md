# Marble-Game
Game where you take turns with a computer taking marbles out of a bag in exact increments of 1, 3, or 4 marbles. The player to remove the last marble wins

This project is my first project with the goal of learning and practicing PyQt5 and Github

# Setup Instructions
- Method 1: With an IDE of your choice and run marble_game.py

- Method 2: Click on the Gitpod icon below and wait until the virtual desktop opens the file for you

# Requirements
- PyQt5

# Game Instructions
- First set the game settings. Select whether you want a randomized amount of beginning marbles in the bag or if you want to choose yourself. Then choose whether you want to make the first move. Click confirm to save your settings and click start to begin the game.
- You can choose how many marbles you want to take out by clicking the buttons 1, 3, or 4 at the top right of the window. 
- The restart button will restart the current active game and the settings button will allow you to go back to the settings box. Also, you can reset the win/lose counter and it will be reset automatically upon closing the window

# Known Bugs
- Jpeg will be replaced eventually
- Some labels did not scale down well in Gitpod so the text is slightly cut off

# Hints
- This game is inspired from an old toy called Dr. Nim
- Once you figure out the algorithm, you can win the game every time. Otherwise, you will lose almost every time (unless you're lucky)
- The first move is the most important
- You're likely to figure out the algorithm using strong induction (Figure out a base case and expand on it!)
